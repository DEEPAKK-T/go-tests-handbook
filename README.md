# ðŸ§ª Go Tests Handbook

**Red, Green, Refactor** â€” A Go project demonstrating **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, making it easy to learn and write effective test cases in Go.  
This repository is structured like a **handbook** with examples ranging from basic tests to integration and benchmarks.

- **01_basic_tests/** â†’ Simple tests to get started
- **02_table_driven_tests/** â†’ Idiomatic Go table-driven tests
- **03_mocks/** â†’ Unit tests with mocking (`testify/mock`, interfaces)
- **04_integration_tests/** â†’ Database / HTTP / file integration tests
- **05_benchmark_tests/** â†’ Performance benchmarks with `go test -bench`
- **docs/** â†’ Notes on TDD, mocking, and Go testing best practices

## Running the Tests

Run all tests in the project (recursively) with:

```bash
go test ./... -v

```

## Explanation

./... â†’ run tests in current directory and all sub-packages

-v â†’ verbose mode, shows:

Which package is being tested

Which tests ran

Which tests passed

Example output:

=== RUN TestSum
--- PASS: TestSum (0.00s)
PASS
ok github.com/deepakkt/go-tests-handbook/01_basic_tests 0.123s

TDD Cycle: Red, Green, Refactor

Red â†’ Write a failing test first

Green â†’ Write minimal code to make the test pass

Refactor â†’ Clean up code and tests

This repo demonstrates this cycle step by step.

## Learning Goals

- How to write unit tests in Go
- Using table-driven tests (idiomatic Go style)
- Creating and using mocks
- Writing integration tests (databases, APIs)
- Measuring performance with benchmarks
- Following the TDD workflow effectively
